alright guys welcome to the CC u 2019 may I masters and my name is Jacob my name is sinners my name is Philip Oh finally they am master today is the finer right now so Simone would you feel like that is our WCG 2019 the very first time here in China Xian you know I'm really looking forward to what is going to happen today you Philip meet you I'm really excited and the players had like two additional weeks to improve their algorithms and they need to perform today in the main stage yeah we have to introduce Philip once again here because actually Philip is one of the developers of this game of our AI masters so Philip here is our true master here yeah true Massa and by the way welcome to see a welcome to China welcome yeah it's a pleasure to be here my first time in Chien and the city is amazing yeah really beautiful Tomas we're here in the WCG is there pressure for us to partner with yous and this here's the question I think a lot of people we would just wonder what is the AMS er and here is the one of the developers that true master doctor available Syria and I want to ask what exactly is a a Masters it's really simple you have five robots in one side five robots in the other side playing football yeah robot soccer and you need to create our strategy to win games but the key point of this game is that you have a set of different techniques to create your AI and you can have a whole new algorithms using deep learning like the alphago the new alphago the new deep blue so gonna see some interesting techniques today wow I mean that sounds really like in let's see the overviews here you can see the price of the Chairman's second answer that Wow it's very crazy and we can see the roots here and the group is around roving on four groups each words four players top two players of each group advantage advance them called master created stage for a lot of a lot of a student or teachers are a lot of just love this AR and we can see they are wrong Romans here we have a lot of country all over the words coming join our en masse to spinal yeah today we have now we can see the scatter here the bad one is the a ice source okay from South Korean food Viesturs China Union also is from the South Korean yeah but is actually exchange student from the chi-wai University and Vasu is kgs GT from South Korean yester er a front person this disturbing so first and the second match here yes so about the first match Philip do you know these players yup this player we can see here this is very handsome here young John from Carnegie Mellon University - both charm and the next is don't don't show me career at name this is a little bit hard for us but it's okay here both of them is very handsome playing fresh here today all right this family check out the rules of the a I'm masters here you know we have to know that arrogancy the as4 ck here as it's data you can see the trending Oh quite a lot here yeah yes yeah Anthony his algorithm Cyril way so he really programs his strategy to teach what the robot should do in each situation and 1332 C what we focus on yes we have this friend babe smash of blazing control oh you can see don't you Lea what is this charge for and we will see right now okay um it gotta be a little bit balanced compared to the other probably defined really good strategy against Jen I just wonder what is a special player a special player you have in the rules we have penalty pigs who have golf kids who have partner Kings depending on the situation the game you need to get this place to score because they're willing like useful in the game and a lot of people do not pay attention on that yeah and let's check it out the Blues of the Headmaster's WCG ai Masters is based on regular soccer game rules for optimal plays kickoff match starts with a kickoff at the beginning of the first and second halves and also a kickoff will be given to the team that loses a point corner kick corner kick will be given when a deadlock occurs around a corner area or when a bolt is out of play by a defender goal kick goal kick is given when too many strikers with a ball charge into the penalty area or when a bull goes out of play by a striker all relocation relocation ball will be relocated when a deadlock occurs excluding the corner areas penalty penalty kick is given when too many defenders are in the penalty area not giving any scoring chances red card sent out when a robot is flipped over it will be removed from the game and resumed playing after a certain period of time all right after day we see how we can see the rule of the am master I just wondering Philip why you will just create these home design as the football game why don't you just decide as RDS or move our game we have a lot of different opportunities from now on and we are evaluating different kind of games and different platforms but the problem here is that we have a really powerful GPUs to train our algorithms and this is gonna be interesting yes and the games began we can see the rest sighs AEI sorter can the blue sighs a china union here we go um and look at static here in wisteria exploring we can see that the blue side from china union has one player stick with the other goal yep but I've just wanted the breast side up to what what what is it doing the app to stay on into the openness gate hits back right now yeah maybe it's a tech turn of that now the blue sides trying to attack here right now the Conner and d1 NT to just fight each other want to find a place Hanford everyone get aboard and after one do pass the ball but no one would care sacks coming around but after mr. M kick kick alright restart restart so the openin the first minute nothing's happened right now it's a penalty Oh alrighty done this is a first coat here y'all the yeah congratulations yeah this a problem with China Union you can see that they commit a lot of Falls and a difference in this game actually yeah I mean this is exactly why you know AI master is different from the real soccer ball yeah because you know you have five five players versus one five players right so and you also even when you have those same rules but here you can see the games are really fast you know the rounds are really fast the guys are really effective here they won't be tired the point is yeah they're playing like real robots right now we can see stay with 1 2 0 and the rest side do you want just catch up over the T two and a half two of the full-size coming around and you see the T 2 and do you want always fight together mark each other yep is that Sarah means he's attacking or defending that that's a good question like this is a counter strategy probably because the opponent team the AI soccer K the red team like he plays with three offensive players in this corner I want you one seam stack they are 50/50 of this game and another difference here is that the China Union team they have the control of this game but they can't score they seem that something's missing for them the often side of the ball yep different of dancing and do you wanna indeed who once again but the app won every time he would kick him stab away oh I evarin get bored and join to the corner and d1 carefully of that and get a poor pass away use the war that's a smart I mean the balls just you know yeah or the whole field that will become more faster if you're passing a wisdom that that war this can get really confusing because you know in real soccer ball we don't play this way and everyone once again followed him sauter way right if you went get aboard and f1 we started oh come on once again tea to everyone mmm I'm is the f1 whoa and can you imagine for the players they develop the code and right now they can't do anything but just observe their AI plane yeah how they're feeling right now how do you think but they are thinking in this moment yeah I mean they just you just have to sit there and do nothing right yup I mean what kind of game is this and they're from one I can see that it's designed for bouncing oh I can see um the blue side China you know always use the word bouncing this board that's really effective in this game yeah once again oh but it's bell um but that degrees for oh it's a penalty kick Oh what is that another one alright once again come you're wrong okay all right we saw and still a one to one here's the four and forty right now we're finishing the first half already yup the first half still 10 second a right into the corner the first step is about to end but we as we can see from both sides they are now going anywhere yup and the first half will be and end up this time maybe at the time spin stop but see they still struggling off the ball but this is the last round of that and after trying to attack about the GK it's ketchup or that goalkeeper is still okay for that all right stuck again Oh in this point is because like the simulator time you use simulator steps yeah I have five minutes in the simulator steps yeah so when you get to five minutes like the last part of the simulator steps to finish the first half so the first half darhk's of really 5050 just one to one here right now yeah and we can see the first half highlights red is let's check it out Araya cross that's him across Dr Ng the highlight we can actually see and actually read that star of both side we can see the blue team just do that use the warning bouncy knees with a bow and the rest side actually I don't worry there so understand of that so Phillip what can you see out there red side the red side is the problems that they have three.hoorah bots on the orphans that wait for opportunities so they do not control the ball possession and they're not controlling the game they let China Union control the game and they rely on the special player in the game and this actually every match from the Kalevala firing round when AI soccer k-16 you against China Union with the same strategy but right now things are different and the game is going to be competitive Wow I mean it seems like you know this is the first match of the game okay I mean I'm sure a lot of you are just like me very confused about this game still you know so but don't worry we are as new as you you know just yeah everybody's kind of new to this but we would try to explain more and more here and we'll hopefully you know we'll get to know you about this game but you know here not everybody can play this game you know these people are from all around the world they are all from famous universities are they are highly intelligent you know I think maybe Jaco and I you know we are IQ compared you know by the way I'm not a good student here and just make sense term color-wise go forth we can see this also K is 45 and it goes again to 36 if that makes sense they I'm almost playing defense this morn but they are not so just aggressive with that yeah no here we go yeah ii happy 0 alright here we go again so the program is the same maybe the second half there the consequence may be the same of that yeah it looks like you know hopefully something will change yep yeah the physics in the simulator we have the randomness of the physics so the game is always different that's why it's hard to create a good artificial intelligence because you need to handle the physics of the simulator and we always have different opportunities during the game so every time you know you let your a I play the game the result may be different yep for sure it's different they were learning by themself actually so what we call that or FISA right out of he sure in challenging well that one that point is actually like real soccer ball because you know no real soccer ball the result just turned out to be single so up there chess yeah alright they've stopped here in the f1 what it's a virtues doing their stop it's a corner kick yeah okay okay everyone get it but it doesn't make sense seems the app once should be the attacker and and that time is a very great opportunity portable side it was really a good opportunity alright the kidding back and the source okay we'll find out what's going on all right coming back everyone just get a ball but I have to catch around and three of them kicking around restart and d1 catch poor once you go and after you every time he would kicked him South away and just kick the ball off the wall and just holding back why is that yeah I mean every time you could see the China Union here try to get the ball back to his side you know I don't know what started you sure here we go again see you need to get the different route to attack the game on the corners and this is a critical point you're gonna see another seems that they have really good plates on the corners and this improve their overall by a lot yep their offensive plays much better because of the corner play so sunshiny Union is good at special plays right yeah they rely on a special place for sure the axilla extremely special really this how absolute Gator boys do pulling back and yeah it's a penalty kick yes big once again I can see the China Union they need to attack right now all right special paint once again t21 fight each other and everyone get a ball but it just passed through the app to but I had to we pull back they need to kick yeah I haven't seen a kick right now it's been 33 minutes yeah I'm think for me you know blue sides need more Oh players yeah and this match is crucial for both teams in this group like because we have a clear favorite in kgs DT but the other players in this group they are really competitive and they need to play well and create offensive opportunities if they want to qualify for the quarter-finals for sure yeah definitely they have to change right now because this is more about a defensive of that about at a gap one get a poor but GK just kiss the boys it's nice pending by GK here yup right d1 poor it doesn't have the headboard in this game right now you can slay the bull with his head and they scored a penalty kick another one this is a problem of China [Music] congratulation together now is free to one this also K here's got some advantage here three penalty kicks yup and we're gonna see the problem of the China Union this defines a lot and without attack it's a good opportunity again again but after just doing this very slow so the GK can defends easily alright once again after we pull back I know where the F - we're going alright I've to get a ball okay pass through the f1 once again okay mmm something like that I mean a really good one actually yeah yep it's fast it's really really fast so the cheek' cannot just react so as that fast I in the second half it's been over right now and congratulation of the saucer cake here get a full one and won this game wow man but the problem of the breast sided China unit has a big big big problem so depends a lot an attack is very very slow and without any thread through the elements for that and highlights ready let's check it out what's going on let's take a look yeah it's very amazing of the x-l of that king right now but we can see the China Union have a lot of problem here but Philip and what you will will advise him I advised them because they had the control of this game they had the opportunity to win this game but they couldn't score they couldn't crew likes Corwin in the offense so they really need to improve the speed of their offensive player and do not commit penalties because the opponent will capitalize on that opportunity yes you don't want to give any opportunity to China Union here right yes so as we can see here the first half is actually I mean no matter the first half or the second half you can see China Union here always he has a lot of opportunities to get a bore but he you know I think he you know always lose the chance to attack you know he has the ball over the other size goal but he didn't get he didn't attack yeah that's his problem because I think the attack point will be more than a defensive one it's more important actually I admit that the special play is very surprised for me there after we pull back the ball and use the use of water passing the boy into the gate but definitely it didn't work it didn't work really well yeah but you're gonna see teams that they really gonna control and be effective in this ball possession and it's a lot of information in this game because sometimes you can't get the strategy that is within the game but you're gonna see a lot of team relying in this ball possession and have kick opportunities like the last goal the last goal you see that the kicking opportunity in the midfield and when the team has this opportunity they need to capitalize yeah I mean is this some kind of special play as well it's a special play the teams look for kicking opportunities and a lot of people rely on this strategy yes but this game is over this is the first game and congratulation to the suitcase again but I say a thing the China Union don't need to worry because this is double eliminations here oh no that's not a double all right so this is CERN first game is so for the shame of that but I think the saucer came maybe will improve more for the final because for now the stategies as that I think is not enough yeah III think that China Union here now has a really difficult group-stage because they lost the first game that was really competitive but they will need to find and win against really strong teams to pacify this heart for them right now yeah I mean so we now have watched [Music] yeah the first game is over and the next game meets the robot and neuter exciting so just wait a second and we're back soon\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DLhmIOqlih9y","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
